                            <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. 
                            Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. 
                            Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! 
                            We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. 
                            Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. 
                            Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!
                            - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. 
                            Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? -

                <h1 id="section3">History of Beekeeping</h1>
                <p id="paragraph3">Egyption records show that bees were provided with domiciles and kept for honey as early as 3000BC.
                    The products that bees produced were so saught after that the Romans implemented taxes on honey and beeswax. Honeybees were traditionally(and still are in certain places) kept in clay pots, hollow logs, wicker baskets, and straw hives.
                    However, the amount of honey produced by these methods were subpar, this lead to the development of the modern day moveable-frame hive. It is important to note that beekeeping is not restricted to keeying honeybees. 
                    In Central and South America, traditional beekeeping for honey has been practiced for thousands of years with "stingless" bees (Meliponini). Beekeeping also includes the keeping of bees for the purpose of crop pollination.
                </p>
                <p id="paragraph4"> Bees are extremely fuzzy and generally friendly if you don't get to close to their hive unlike their close cousins the wasp. Wasps sting you for fun but not bees! Bees will only sting you if you've done something to anger them so if you've ever 
                    been stung by a bee I guess that means you're not a very nice person :^)
